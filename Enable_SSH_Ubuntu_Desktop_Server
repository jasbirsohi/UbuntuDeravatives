# How to Install and Configure SSH on Ubuntu

# Step 1: Prepare Ubuntu
s
# Step 2: Install SSH on Ubuntu
sudo apt install openssh-server
# Step 3: Start SSH
sudo systemctl enable --now ssh
# To verify that the service is enabled and running successfully, type
sudo systemctl status ssh
# If you want to disable the service, execute
sudo systemctl disable ssh
# Step 4: Configure the firewall
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw allow ssh
# Step 5: Connect to the server
ssh username@IP_address





# Optional Steps for SSH Security on Ubuntu
# Configure SSH
# The main OpenSSH server settings are stored in the main configuration file sshd_config (location: /etc/ssh). Before you start editing, you should create a backup of this file
sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.initial
# If you get any errors after editing the configuration file, you can restore the original file without problems
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# In the file, change the port to a more secure one. It is best to set values from the dynamic range of ports (49152 - 65535) and use different numbers for additional security. For example, let's change the port value to 49532. To do this, we uncomment the corresponding line in the file and change the port

Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf

#Port 22


# In addition to this setting, we recommend changing the password authentication mode to a more secure key authentication mode. To do this, uncomment the corresponding line and make sure the value is "Yes"

#PubkeyAuthentication yes



# Now, let's prohibit logging on to the server as a superuser by changing the corresponding line as shown in the picture below.

#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password

# There are other settings you can configure to increase the server security: 

# UseDNS checks if the hostname matches its IP address. The value "Yes" enables this parameter.

# PermitEmptyPasswords prohibits using empty passwords for authentication if the value is "No."
# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
#PasswordAuthentication yes
#PermitEmptyPasswords no


# MaxAuthTries limits the number of unsuccessful attempts to connect to the server within one communication session. 

# AllowUsers and AllowGroups are responsible for the list of users and groups allowed to access the server:

# AllowUsers User1, User2, User3
# AllowGroups Group1, Group2, Group3

# Login GraceTime sets the time provided for successful authorization. We recommend reducing the value of this parameter by four times.

# ClientAliveInterval limits the time of user inactivity. After exceeding the specified limit, the user is disconnected.

# After making all the changes in the main configuration file, save them and close the editor. 


#LoginGraceTime 2m
#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
#StrictModes yes
#MaxAuthTries 6
#MaxSessions 10


# Restart the service to make the changes take effect
sudo systemctl restart ssh

# If you have changed the port in the configuration file, you should connect using the new port
ssh -p port_number username@IP_address
ssh -p port_number_port_username@domain
